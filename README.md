# Firebase CLI for Monorepos

This is an experimental fork of the [Firebase Tools](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-tools) which integrates [isolate-package](https://github.com/0x80/isolate-package/) as part of the functions `deploy` command in order to [support monorepo setups](https://thijs-koerselman.medium.com/deploy-to-firebase-without-the-hacks-e685de39025e). Alternatively, you can manually configure `isolate` as part of the `predeploy` step of your configuration, but having the process integrated and only running as part of the deploy command is essential if you like to preserve live code updates when running the Firebase emulators locally during development.

I think it might take some time before the Firebase team would agree to make isolate an integral part of the toolchain, if ever, because the package itself is still very new.

In the meantime I will try to keep this fork in sync with updates to the original tools. The published versions of the fork will be kept the same as the original `firebase-tools` package, so you can easily see how up-to-date it is.

## Installation

It is probably best to install this as a local dependency on whatever package you want to deploy to Firebase, as opposed to using a global install. This way the forked binary does not interfere with the original one on your system, and you can easily use the fork on one project will still using the original one on others.

```bash
npm install firebase-tools-with-isolate
```

Generally I advise you to [use PNPM](https://pnpm.io/feature-comparison) for monorepo setups. At the moment, `isolate-package` only supports generating isolated lockfiles for PNPM, but you can always choose to deploy to Firebase without a lockfile, similar to other workarounds people have been using.

```bash
pnpm add firebase-tools-with-isolate
```

## Commands

Installing the fork locally provides you with the same `firebase` command but in order to execute any command on the command line you prefix it with `npx` like `npx firebase deploy`.

If you are using the commands as part of a package.json script, `npx` is not required, because scripts already prefer locally installed binaries when available.

## Configure

You have to opt-in to the functions isolate process by setting `functions.isolate: true` in your `firebase.json`. For example:

```json
{
  "functions": {
    "source": "./dist",
    "runtime": "nodejs20",
    "predeploy": ["turbo build"],
    "isolate": true
  }
}
```
